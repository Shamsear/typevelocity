## Performance Optimization

TypeVelocity is optimized for performance in the following ways:

1. **Efficient DOM Updates**: Character elements are reused rather than recreated for each typing session.

2. **Debounced Event Handlers**: Input event handlers use debouncing to prevent excessive function calls.

3. **Lazy Loading**: Non-critical resources are loaded only when needed.

4. **Animation Optimization**: 
   - CSS transitions are preferred over JavaScript animations when possible
   - Hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) are used for smooth animations
   - Animations are disabled for users who prefer reduced motion

5. **Memory Management**:
   - Event listeners are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
   - Large data structures are efficiently managed

6. **Caching Strategies**:
   - User data is cached in localStorage to minimize API calls
   - Frequently accessed DOM elements are cached in variables

7. **Reduced Network Requests**:
   - SVG icons are used instead of icon fonts or image files
   - Base64 encoding for small images reduces HTTP requests

8. **Optimized Audio**:
   - Audio context is reused for all sound effects
   - Sound effects are generated programmatically instead of loading audio files

## Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper ARIA roles and labels for screen readers
