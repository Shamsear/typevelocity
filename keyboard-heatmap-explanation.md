# TypeVelocity Keyboard Error Heatmap

## Overview

The Keyboard Error Heatmap is an interactive visualization tool that helps users identify patterns in their typing errors. By tracking and visualizing which keys are most frequently mistyped, users can focus their practice on problematic areas to improve typing accuracy and speed.

## Key Features

### 1. Error Tracking and Visualization

- **Real-time Error Detection**: Monitors typing input and identifies mistyped characters during typing sessions
- **Persistent Error Data**: Stores error frequencies in LocalStorage to track patterns over time
- **Color-coded Visualization**: Uses a green-yellow-red color scale to represent error frequency
- **Comprehensive Keyboard Layout**: Displays a full QWERTY keyboard with all standard keys

### 2. Interactive Components

- **Mini-heatmap**: A compact keyboard visualization that can be toggled during typing sessions
- **Results Modal Integration**: Detailed heatmap appears after completing typing challenges
- **Reset Capability**: Option to reset error data and start fresh
- **Animated Feedback**: Visual indication when errors occur

## Technical Implementation

### Error Tracking Approach

The heatmap uses a multi-layered approach to track typing errors:

1. **Real-time Tracking**: During typing, the system compares each character typed against the expected character in the prompt
2. **Post-session Analysis**: After completing a challenge, a comprehensive comparison identifies all errors
3. **Aggregated Data**: Error counts are accumulated over time to reveal persistent patterns
4. **Normalized Keys**: Keys are normalized (lowercase) to focus on character errors rather than case errors

### Data Structure

```javascript
// Error data is stored as a simple key-value object:
{
  "a": 5,  // User mistyped 'a' 5 times
  "s": 12, // User mistyped 's' 12 times
  "d": 3,  // User mistyped 'd' 3 times
  // etc.
}
```

### Visualization Logic

The heatmap uses a relative intensity scale to visualize errors:

1. **Maximum Error Detection**: The system identifies the most frequently mistyped key
2. **Intensity Calculation**: Each key's error count is compared to the maximum (creating a 0-1 scale)
3. **Color Assignment**:
   - No errors: Gray background
   - Low errors (0-33% of max): Green
   - Medium errors (34-66% of max): Yellow
   - High errors (67-100% of max): Red
4. **Visual Cues**: Keys with errors receive a glow effect proportional to their error frequency

## User Experience Benefits

### Learning Insights

- **Pattern Recognition**: Users can identify if they consistently mistype certain keys
- **Finger Placement Issues**: Patterns may reveal problems with hand positioning
- **Progress Tracking**: Improvements become visible as previously problematic keys show fewer errors

### Accessibility Considerations

- **ARIA Attributes**: All keyboard elements include proper ARIA roles and labels
- **Screen Reader Support**: Error counts are available to screen readers
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Animations respect user preferences for reduced motion
- **Color Contrast**: Colors meet WCAG AA standards for visibility

### Mobile Responsiveness

- **Adaptive Layout**: Keyboard scales appropriately on smaller screens
- **Touch-friendly Controls**: All interactive elements have adequate touch targets
- **Compact Mini-view**: Simplified keyboard for mobile screens

## Usage Tips

1. **Identify Problem Keys**: Look for red and yellow keys to identify your most common errors
2. **Practice Problematic Characters**: Create custom practice sessions focusing on your error-prone keys
3. **Track Improvements**: Reset the heatmap periodically to see if your error patterns change
4. **Use the Mini-heatmap**: Toggle the mini-heatmap during practice to get immediate feedback

## Technical Performance Considerations

- **Efficient DOM Updates**: The heatmap minimizes DOM manipulations for smooth performance
- **Debounced Updates**: Visualization updates are optimized to prevent performance issues
- **Minimal Storage Impact**: The error data uses minimal localStorage space
- **Lazy Initialization**: Components are created only when needed

By visualizing typing errors in this intuitive way, the Keyboard Error Heatmap transforms abstract typing statistics into actionable insights, helping users develop more accurate and efficient typing skills.
